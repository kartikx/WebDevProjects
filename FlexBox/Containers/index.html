            <h2> About FlexBox Containers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To start off we have flex direction, which is by default row. It controls the direction
                        in which your flex box grows. Changing the flex-direction may be useful, if you want
                        to build a responsive navbar which switches to a stacked column of links when the screen
                        is short enough.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The next property is flex wrap which is by default no wrap. This means that the 
                        flexbox will try to fit the entire contents in a single row (if your flex direction is
                        row). This can lead to some unwanted results such as your items not responding
                        to the width property, because your flex-box will try to fit them closely in the row.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Flex Flow combines the two properties mentioned above. Hence you could set: 
                        flex-flow : row nowrap.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Next we have Justify-Content. This controls the movement of items
                        along the main axis. So if your flex-direction is row, then setting
                        Justify-Content to "center" would aggregate all elements along
                        that row in the center.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Align Items, on the other hand, deals with the movement of items
                        along the cross-axis. For rows this would be the vertical direction.
                        Note that Align Items and Justify Content work with individual rows/columns.
                        So basically you have a "wide" row, and you're telling CSS where you want
                        the item positioned vertically. You may position in the center of the row, at 
                        the end, at the start etc.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Align Contents is similar to Align Items. However, it only works with multiple rows, 
                        and will often overwrite Align Items (or vv). It also deals with movement across the cross axis,
                        however it controls the entire group. Align-Content of Flex-End would move
                        all the elements towards the end, wheras Align-Items of Flex-End only moves
                        the element to the end of their respective rows.
                    </p>
