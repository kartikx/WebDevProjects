        <!-- 
        Here's how we've set it up:
        From the CSS pov, the modal is always active i.e. is-active is set.

        We're going to use the v-if directive from view to control whether
        to show the modal or not. This directive depends on a bool value
        set within the app Vue instance.

        Setting the modal visible is then easy, using the button's
        onClick directive. However, setting it invisible, not so. 
        This is because, the button for closing is embedded within the HTML
        of the modal Component, and doesn't have access to this bool.
        
        Hence we make use of a signal, which is emitted by this button (and hence,
        the modal itself). This is a custom signal close, which appears similar to
        click. When this signal is emmitted, we know we should set the visibility
        to false.
